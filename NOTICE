## License Scope Clarification

**This Apache-2.0 license applies to:**
- Hardware IP content (RTL, SystemVerilog, VHDL files)
- IP documentation and specifications
- Testbenches and verification code
- Design constraints and configuration files
- Generated reports and analysis results

**This license does NOT apply to:**
- The template structure and directory organization
- Build processes and CI/CD workflows
- Tool installation and setup procedures
- Template metadata and configuration templates
- The Vyges CLI tool and related tooling
- **AI context and processing engine components:**
  - `.vyges-ai-context.json` - AI development context and prompts
  - `.copilot-chat-context.md` - GitHub Copilot integration context
  - `.cursorrules` - Cursor editor AI rules and conventions

The template provides a framework for IP development but the licensing terms apply specifically to the hardware IP content you create using this framework. The AI context and processing engine are proprietary Vyges components provided as-is for enhanced development experience.
